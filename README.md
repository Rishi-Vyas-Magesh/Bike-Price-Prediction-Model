# Bike-Price-Prediction-Model
This is a Linear Regression Model I built with a dataset I found a Kaggle on "Bike Price Data".

I understood the data and its elements. Since I have a Mechanical backgroud, that helps too with critical understanding of the features and their possible ranges.
You can see in thr IPYNB file my work on reading,cleaning,structuring and pre-processing of data to make it viable for a predictive model. You can also see feature engineering, Multicollinearity Analysis and other supervised and unsupervised methods used. The model was then "Train_test_split" and Linear Regression ML was applied for training.

Toward the end you can find the Evaluation metrics of the Linear Reg model too which I arrived at.

In this repo, I have attached the IPYNB file I came up with and the ppt is a downloadable version

Thank You
